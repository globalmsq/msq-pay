## üîç Verifying Payments

You can verify payments in **3 different ways**:

1. **Wallet Result API**

   ```http
   POST {API Base URL}/wallet/result
   ```

   Response contains `status: completed` or `prepared`.

2. **WebSocket Listener**

   * Listen for `MSQPAY_TRANSACTION_SUCCESS` events.
   * Recommended for mobile apps or when redirect is not possible.

3. **Callback URL**

   * Set a callback URL during platform registration.
   * MSQ Pay will send POST requests after every successful transaction.
   * Always validate by **checking the allowed IP** (`13.125.119.187`).
